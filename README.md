# 🏫 School Website Management System Source Code
This repository contains the source code and supporting files for a School Website Management System. The project is designed as a dynamic PHP web application to manage school data such as students, teachers, lessons, exams, and reports, while also providing a structured front-end for administrative and user interaction.

The codebase follows real-world web development practices including modular PHP files, structured folder organization, database-driven content, and reusable UI components—making it a solid foundation for educational institution websites.

## 📦 Contents
This project includes:
- Multiple PHP pages for managing school modules:
  - Students (`siswa`)
  - Teachers (`guru`)
  - Lessons (`pelajaran`)
  - Exams (`ujian`)
  - Reports (`report`)
  - User authentication (`auth`)
- Database setup file (`db_sekolah.sql`) for MySQL
- Configuration file (`config.php`) for database connection
- Front-end templates and assets (CSS, JS, images)
- Structured folder layout for modularity and maintainability

The project demonstrates how a dynamic, data-driven school website can be structured using PHP and MySQL.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- PHP — server-side logic and dynamic page rendering  
- MySQL — database management and queries  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript — front-end layout, styling, and interactivity  
- Modular PHP includes — reusable headers, footers, and templates  

These technologies are combined to create a fully functional school website with administrative and user interaction capabilities.

## 🚀 Features
- Dynamic CRUD operations for school data
- User authentication and role-based access
- Responsive front-end layout
- Modular PHP templates for easy maintenance
- Database-driven content management

## 🔍 Project Overview
The School Website Management System was developed as part of academic coursework to provide a practical example of a fully functional PHP web application. Each module demonstrates a key aspect of web development: from front-end layout and design to back-end logic and database management. The project is suitable for educational institutions looking to manage and present school data online.
